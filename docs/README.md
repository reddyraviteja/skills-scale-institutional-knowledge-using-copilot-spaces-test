# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation
 
This documentation outlines the standardized project management processes used at OctoAcme to ensure consistent planning, execution, and delivery of initiatives across teams.
 
## Overview of Project Management Processes
 
OctoAcme follows a structured project lifecycle that begins with project initiation and scope definition, followed by detailed planning, execution and tracking, release and deployment, and continuous improvement through retrospectives. Each phase includes clear handoffs, defined responsibilities, and quality checkpoints to reduce risk and improve predictability.
 
Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined across project managers, product owners, engineering leads, and stakeholders. Decision-making authority and escalation paths are documented to ensure timely resolution of blockers and alignment across teams.
 
Communication is managed through regular status updates, risk reviews, and cross-functional checkpoints. Risks are proactively identified, tracked, and communicated, ensuring transparency and informed decision-making throughout the project lifecycle
 
Quality assurance is embedded through reviews, acceptance criteria, deployment validations, and retrospectives, enabling continuous improvement and knowledge sharing across projects.
